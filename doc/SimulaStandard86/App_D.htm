<h1>APPENDIX D<br>
Statutes of the SIMULA Standards Group (SSG)</h1>
<pre>

 </pre>

 <h2>Article 1. Objectives</h2>

 The SIMULA Standards Group (SSG) is an organisation which at all times
 shall:

 1.1      be the final arbiter in the interpretation of the SIMULA
          language definition and be a centre for custody of this formal
          definition.

 1.2      standardise the SIMULA language by minimizing its changes and
          preventing occurrence of SIMULA translators violating the
          language definition.

 1.3      provide a forum for discussion and exchange of information
          relating to the use of the SIMULA language and its support.


 <h2>Article 2. Membership</h2>

 2.1      The SSG offers both full and extraordinary membership. Only
          full members have voting rights.

 2.2      Full membership is open to organisations and firms responsible
          for the maintenance and support of a SIMULA system. It is
          required that each such SIMULA system is in active use.

          Any such organisation may apply for and be voted a full SSG
          member.

 2.3      The Norwegian Computing Center (NCC), Oslo, Norway is ex
          officio a full member of the SSG. In addition, the SIMULA
          Development Group (SDG) Chairman and the Association of SIMULA
          Users (ASU) Chairman are also full members of the SSG.

 2.4      The SSG can offer extraordinary membership to individuals in
          recognition of their contribution to the SSG work.

 2.5      Once granted an SSG membership lasts until:

                - it is resigned by a particular member

                - it is revoked by the SSG because the conditions under
                  which it was granted cease to exist or the member acts
                  against the objectives of the SSG.

 2.6      There is no fee for SSG membership.

 <h2>Article 3. Representation, Voting and Meetings</h2>

 3.1      All SSG members shall appoint one person to be its
          representative in the SSG. The duration of this person's
          appointment is determined by the member.

 3.2      The SSG shall meet once every calendar year for an Annual
          Meeting. This meeting will, in addition to eventual matters of
          an administrative character, handle proposals related to the
          SIMULA language definition as described in the Formal Rules of
          the SSG operation. The Annual Meeting shall also elect one of
          the full member's representatives as SSG Chairman.

          In addition to the Annual Meeting the SSG may have
          extraordinary meetings when this is approved by a majority of
          the members.

          Decisions can only be taken regarding matters on the agenda
          presented to the members at least 3 weeks before the meeting,
          unless all members agree otherwise.

 3.3      To constitute a quorum, all members of the SSG shall be
          notified of the Meeting and at least one more than a half of
          the member representatives shall be present or give their votes
          by mail.

 3.4      Decisions by SSG are made by a majority vote among the
          representatives taking part in the vote. Changes to the SSG
          Statutes or a decision to dissolve the SSG, require 4/5
          majority, as well as the consent of the NCC.

 3.5      The SSG meetings are open to non-members who wish to aattend.
          Such non-members will be granted observer status by the SSG.
          Observers have no voting rights and must apply to the SSG for
          each meeting they wish to attend.

 <h2>Formal rules of the SSG operation</h2>


 1.  The main task of the SSG is the maintenance of the SIMULA language
     definition (Common Base) which consists of:

       a) a clarification of obscure parts of the definition.

       b) removal of possible conflicts in the definition.

       c) alteration of the definition in line with the approved changes
          in the language.


 2.  The following types of language changes can be directly considered
     by the SSG:

       a) obvious oversights that have occurred in the text of the
          language definition during editing/printing.

       b) removal of language restrictions that are proved obsolete for
          language consistency and implementation.

       c) trivial extensions to the existing concepts that are felt
          relevant for continued use of the language in changing
          environment.

     All other changes must first be handled by the SDG and passed over
     in the form of a formal recommendation.


 3.  All proposals for language changes conforming to the above rules
     must be formulated in writing in a concise manner and submitted to
     the SSG secretariat. Any SIMULA user may submit such a proposal.


 4   It is the responsibility of the SSG Chairman to notify receipt of
     each proposal, to register it and schedule its processing at one of
     the SSG meetings. Alternatively the SSG Chairman may point out any
     inadequacies in a proposal to its submitter.

     In either case the proposal will be announced at the next SSG
     meeting which may approve or revoke the Chairman's decision related
     to this proposal.

     Complete material related to a particular proposal will only be
     submitted to SSG members when the proposal is to be processed at the
     next meeting or on specific request.


 5.  In its final form every proposal will be an updating text to the
     Common Base. It will further indicate the original submitter, date
     of submission and its motivation. Alternative forms of the proposal
     and reasons for their rejection are valuable parts of the document.
     An example of a suitable form is attached to these rules.

     The logical consistency of the text, its clarity and conciseness are
     of utmost importance. To this aim the SSG or its Chairman may
     allocate one particular SSG member to bring the proposal into the
     required shape if this is deemed necessary.


 6.  It is the responsibility of the SSG Chairman to notify the submitter
     of a proposal about the result of its processing by the SSG if this
     is not otherwise obvious. It is also his/her responsibility to
     minimize the time spent on each proposal.


 7.  The final text of the proposals will be available from the SSG
     secratariat as a supplement to the Common Base until they are
     incorporated into this at its next revision. To simplify this
     process, at its approval a proposal will be assigned a number
     reflecting both the Common Base version it applies to and its
     chronological order.
